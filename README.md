🧐 Project Overview
This project analyzes a health insurance dataset to understand which factors influence insurance costs and builds regression models to predict insurance charges. The models include linear regression and possibly more advanced regressors. The goal is:

To explore trends and relationships in the data
To build predictive models
To evaluate the performance of those models
To derive actionable insights
📂 Dataset
The data comes from a public dataset (Kaggle), which includes individual-level health insurance data.
Key fields include: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, and charges.
🔍 Features
Here are some of the variables used:

Feature	Description
age	Age of the individual
sex	Gender (male / female)
bmi	Body Mass Index
children	Number of children the individual has
smoker	Whether the individual is a smoker or not
region	Geographic region
charges	Insurance cost (target variable)
📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Investigating distribution of continuous features (age, BMI, children)
Checking for correlations between variables
Visualizing differences in charges by smoker status, region, etc.
Handling categorical variables via encoding
Checking for outliers/missing values
🤖 Modeling
Splitting data into training and test sets
Using one or more regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, maybe Ridge / Lasso / ElasticNet)
Feature engineering / preprocessing (encoding categorical vars, scaling if needed)
Hyperparameter tuning (if implemented)
📊 Evaluation Metrics
Typical metrics used to evaluate regression models:

RMSE — Root Mean Squared Error
MAE — Mean Absolute Error
R² (R-squared) — Coefficient of determination
🏆 Results
Summary of which model performed best
Interpretation of predictions vs actual costs
Key insights from the model (e.g. “smoker status has the largest impact”, etc.)
